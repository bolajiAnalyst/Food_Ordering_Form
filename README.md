This task features a custom food ordering form built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for Bolaji food Hub. It enables clients to place orders for vegetarian or non-vegetarian meals. Orders are processed through a custom Webhook, and instant confirmations are delivered via Webhook responses. Here's the form image.![Food Ordering Form Screenshot](/image/Food_Automation.png)
